# EPA replication in progress

This is my code (in progress) to replicate for the following paper:

["A Multiresolution Stochastic Process Model for Predicting NBA Possession Outcomes"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0777).
by Dan Cervone, Alex D'Amour, Luke Bornn, Kirk Goldsberry

*I used some of the code from https://github.com/dcervone/EPVDemo. I am on my way to estimate the parameters being used for this model.
